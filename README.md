The HTML attached is a submitted final report for the Module SOST30062 Data Science Modelling offered by the Department of Social Statistics at the University of Manchester. 
The unit is taught by Tatjana Kecojevic. 
The assessment asks students to apply the most suitable Machine Learning techniques that were taught in the Module to answer the two sets of assigned questions on the respective data sets.
The objective is to produce a comprehensive report documenting the entire modelling process.

The report was written using R Markdown and knitted into an interactive HTML file. To run the R Markdown, please download the data and update the appropriate paths.

Note that all of the work in the final report is this user's work.
