The HTML attached is a submitted final report for the Module SOST30062 Data Science Modelling offered by the Department of Social Statistics at the University of Manchester. 
The unit is taught by Tatjana Kecojevic. 
The assessment asks students to apply the most suitable Machine Learning techniques that were taught in the Module to answer the two sets of assigned questions on the respective data sets.

Question 1 asks students to build a predictive model for medical insurance charges using demographic and lifestyle attributes, evaluate model performance and interpret the results, identifying the most significant predictors of medical expenses.

Question 2 asks students to predict the likelihood of stroke occurrence based on health and demographic data. Students should explore the dataset, handle pre-processing tasks, and construct classification models to predict the Stroke variable. The goal is to evaluate the modelsâ€™ performance and interpret key factors contributing to stroke risk.

Students are to produce a comprehensive report documenting the entire modelling process.

The report was written using R Markdown and knitted into an interactive HTML file. To run the R Markdown, please download the data and update the appropriate paths.

Note that all of the work in the final report is this user's work.
